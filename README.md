# Two man with your pet

## Project info

exactly what it sounds like it's a two man with your cat. [Video demo here](https://youtu.be/frbZMkXZdPI)

Please note the vid is a little confusing since I'm logging in as multiple different users to demo the auth, matching, and liking configurations. For extra context, I first logged in as myself to show the profile creation (I skipped on a pic upload bc I didn't have one on hand, but as you can see from the feed of other profiles, it is entirely functional) and sent a like to my friend Aronne (note that all profiles are entirely live and integrated into the Supabase SQL tables) to showcase the auth and the likes. I then logged in as Aronne and my other friend Michael (who I previously matched during dev to test matching features) to highlight the matching features and the messaging system (the previous messages already in their convo history are from dev testingâ€”please ignore them we were just messing around). Hope this helps!  

### Database Schema

The complete database schema with tables, RLS policies, and functions is available in `docs/schema.sql`. This includes:

- **profiles**: User profile information
- **pets**: Pet profile information  
- **photos**: User and pet photos with storage integration
- **prompts**: Standard prompts for profiles
- **prompt_answers**: User/pet responses to prompts
- **likes**: User interactions and reciprocal like tracking
- **matches**: Matched users from mutual likes

All tables include Row Level Security (RLS) policies to ensure users can only access their own data and public profiles.
